# Real-Time Multiple Objects Tracking DLC-based Framework 

This project meant to exploit the excellence of the inference of DeepLabCut for objects detection, pose estimation
and track them across time (Kalman filter prediction in abscence of detections), rather than process every frame individually Thus, acheiving real-time tracking.The hungarian algorithm was used to solve the data association problem.
